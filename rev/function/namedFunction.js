// so normally if we define a function like 
/*
function (){
}

 so this is called anonymous function because it doesn't have a name.
but if we define a function like this
function foo(){
    console.log("chinmaya")
}
so this is called named function because it has a name.
but if we define a function like this
var foo = function(){
    console.log("chinmaya") 

}
so this is called function expression because it is assigned to a variable.

and also like 

function name (){
    console.log("chinmaya")
}
so this is called dunction statement because it is defined with a name.

but in function expression we can call the function before it is defined because it is hoisted to the top of the scope.
but in function statement we cannot call the function before it is defined because it is not hoisted to the top of the scope.
but in named function we can call the function before it is defined because it is hoisted to the top of the scope.
but in anonymous function we cannot call the function before it is defined because it is not hoisted to the top of the scope.

we can call a anonymous function in function expression but we cannot call a anonymous function in function statement.
